Tally App Number Manipulation JavaScrip

This Folder/Project contains a JavaScript code that demonstrates how to manipulate a numeric value within specified bounds using HTML and JavaScript. The code controls a numeric input field and three buttons: "Add," "Subtract," and "Reset." The primary functionality includes:


Addition/Increment by 1: Clicking the "Add" button increments the numeric value by a predefined step amount until it reaches a maximum value, disabling the button at that point.

Subtraction/Decreement: Clicking the "Subtract" button decrements the numeric value by the same step amount until it reaches a minimum value, disabling the button accordingly.

Resetting: Clicking the "Reset" button resets the numeric value to a predefined default value and, if applicable, interacts with an element that has a show() method.
